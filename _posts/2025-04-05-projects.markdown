# Look who it is, its me!

A placeholder to try to organized my thoughts, show off some of my progress in projects (as best I can without breaking rules). This is a page in flux, might include an actual blog or two, but is mostly a playground.


#### NOAA Projects
---
Senior admin for the following NOAA NCO Applications.
- [SPOT](https://spot.weather.gov)
- [Alertsv2](https://alerts.weather.gov)
- [NWWS-OI](https://www.weather.gov/nwws/)
- [RA4-GIFS](https://ra4-gifs.weather.gov)

#### Slurm
---
Slurm is a batch scheduling system by [SchedMD](https://www.schedmd.com/slurm/).  During my tenure at NOAA, we swapped from the combination of Moab/MAM/Torque from [Adaptive Computing](https://adaptivecomputing.com/moab-hpc-suite/).  The tools for this include:
- `node_stats.py` -> Python script to gather statistics from nodes
- `shold` -> A way of addming/removing a hold on Slurm users.
- `show_slurm_admins` -> a shortcut to output Slurm administrators
- `slurm_install` -> A functional script that will download, compile, and install the specified version of slurm.
- `srequeue` -> A script created during cluster issues.  Attempts torequeue all running jobs so that they are not lost and stay on hold while the cluster is repaired.  This is purposely separate from `sschedctl`, the script that manages the cluster status
- `sschedctl` -> A script created to quickly start & stop the scheduler by altering the status of the Slurm partitions.
- `sstats.py` -> A python script that is meant to gather statistics for a pre-defined amount of time and e-mail administrators to keep a daily statistical record of Slurm acitivy, works with `sstats_daily` bash script
- `sstats_daily` -> A bash script that calls `sstats.py` daily on a cron schedule to keep an admin record of Slurm acitivty.
Further this repository contains my first pass at a usable Ansible playbook.  It needs a lot of work that is coming soon.

### Personal projects
#### Hitsmas.py
---
This was a personal project when I was learning Python while watching [Giant Bomb](giantbomb.com).  Inspired by some weird rulesets they put on the contract mode, I took a crack at trying to script this using pre-defined values.  This was made for the first version of Hitman and has not been updated for any subsequent releases.
