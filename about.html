    Reporting from the sunny shores of the east coast comes someone that just loves tinkering with technology, 
    finding new and fun ways to break everything and then subsequently fix it, the best way to actually learn.
    I've spent my time at NOAA creating solutions that have brought modern architecture and reliability to 
    numerous research projects, applications, and other internal ventures within the organization.

    At home, I prefer the quiet.  Lots of traveling with my wife, getting the required physical activity at the gym
    and keeping the mind busy with my own little infrastructure projects and other means.

    I have no major intentions for this blog/page other than testing it out, seeing how it works, and going from there.
